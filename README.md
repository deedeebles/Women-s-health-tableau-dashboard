I wanted to present insights with a focus on women’s health and well-being. I believe the insights would provide an understanding of factors affecting women’s health, which could then inform product development, marketing, and outreach efforts.

The following are the insights I
generated and the motivation:
### Distribution of Sleep Disorders Among Different Age Groups of Women:
I wanted an
understanding of how age affects sleep disorders among women. This kind of insight could
help develop or improve products that could enhance sleep health in women.

### Weight/BMI Distribution in Women: 
I looked into women’s weight distribution, specifically
those overweight or obese. As these conditions could pose health challenges, femtech companies could
intervene by developing new products or features that could improve these conditions.

### Average Stress Levels Among Women Based on Occupation: 
I wanted to look at how
occupational demands could affect women’s health and well-being as this could help femtech companies
develop wellness solutions tailored at specific professions.

### Distribution of Sleep Disorder Across Different Occupations: 
Lastly, I visualised
how different professions are associated with sleep disorders.
